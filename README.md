# Moodle Breaker

This product solves a huge problem of a modern MIPT student, who usually is pretty busy with different difficult tasks, apart from English ones on Moodle.

The way you use it very simple: you go to URL, containing English test on Moodle and press on the **M** (icon) button of this extension in your toolbar, and here it is - 100% right answers for the test are in front you. All you need to do is to confirm all the fields.

If you have any suggestions, you can create a new issue in this repo.

## Warning!

Keep in mind that at the moment there are solved only those tasks that are verified **without** reloading the current page.

## TODO

* Random duration of tasks
* Other tasks, which check on the server side of Moodle
* Translation using Google Translator or other system
